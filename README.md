## Setup

Ensure Python is installed correctly

Install all Python dependencies from requirements.txt using:
```bash=
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Run the Code

The main script is `temporal_hybrid_assignment.py`. Once you have implemented the required functions, you can run it from your terminal.

1. **Configure the script:** Open the `if __name__ == '__main__':` block at the bottom of the script and update the file paths and tuning parameters as needed.
2. **Run from the command line:**

```bash=
python temporal_hybrid_assignment.py
```

This will generate the output image in the same directory.
